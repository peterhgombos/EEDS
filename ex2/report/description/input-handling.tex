\subsection{Input handling}
To prevent multiple inputs when pressing a button, a debouncer is used.
As a button is pressed, an interrupt is fired. 
This will wake the micro controller up from sleep mode, and then sends the signal to the debouncer, in buttons.c.
As this method is called, a timer is set up.
This is used to see how long since the last input, and if it's too short time between inputs, the method returns.
If not, the debounce function in listing \ref{lst:debounce} is called.
This is taken from \cite{debouncer}.

\lstinputlisting[caption={Debouncer}, label={lst:debounce}, linerange={49-67}]{../code/buttons.c}

As soon as the input is verified, it is added to the event queue for the state machine.

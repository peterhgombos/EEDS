\subsection{Input handling}
To prevent multiple and unintended inputs from unstable button values, a debouncing routine is used to prevent signal propagation untill a stable value can be accuired.

When a GPIO interrupt is received, the GPIO interrupt handler starts a debounce timer which will run for a predefined number of cycles, before turning itself off again.
The corresponding interrupt handler reads current  GPIO values, accepts them if the debouncing routine\ref{lst:debounce} deems the input stable, and reject them otherwise.
If the input is accepted, the corresponding event is put in the queue of the FSM.

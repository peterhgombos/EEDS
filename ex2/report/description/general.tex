\subsection{General description}

When the implemented program runs on a micro controller, it will play a self composed intro sound, before giving control to the user.

He or she can then navigate between the available songs using the left and right buttons (1 and 3) on gamepad, and both play, pause and resume the currently selected song using the pause buttong (2).
The LEDs on the gamepad indicate which song is currently selected \ref{fig:systemaction}.

When the system is idling, it shuts down everything and enters deep sleep, conserving valuable energy, in turn guaranteeing a long and fruitful life for our little walkman.

The current repertoire of songs include the self composed Marimba, multiple sound effects from Super Mario Bros \cite{mariobros}, and random garbage data found just outside the notes array during debugging (not available in production release).

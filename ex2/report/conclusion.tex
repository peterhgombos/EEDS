\section{Conclusion}
The program was implemented as intended from the specification. All the required features, with an interface created by the writers.

Even though the program implemented in this assignment fits the specifications needed, more could have been done to save energy, by for instance implementing DMA.
The implementation does use little energy when idling, but uses a too much when playing music.

Some of the implementation is done perhaps a bit too detailed for such a small task, but this makes the code easier to extend to a full application.

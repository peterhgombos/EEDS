\section{Conclusion}
The program was implemented according to specification. All required features are present, as well as an easily extendible state machine and a generic interface for including new songs into the system.

Even though the described program fits the system requirements and uses little energy while idling, more things could have been done to save power during playback, amongst others adding DMA support.

Parts of the implementation are deeper than required for such a small task, but this makes the code easier to extend to a full application.

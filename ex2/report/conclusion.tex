\section{Conclusion}
Even though the program implemented in this assignment fits the specifications needed, a bit more could have been done to save energy.
The implementation does use little energy when idling, but uses a bit too much when playing music.

Some of the implementation is done perhaps a bit too detailed for such a small task, but this makes the code easier to extend to a full application.

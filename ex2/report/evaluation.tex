\section{Evaluation of Assignment}
While the goals of the exercise and how to achieve them were good, how to use the DMA to feed the DAC could have been better documented, as the official docs on this are not very good.
It's does not feel fulfilling to hunt through documentation to save a bit more energy when it is not needed for the exercise. 
At least there should have been some text on where to find out more specific about the DMA and how to use it.

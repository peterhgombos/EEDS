\section{Introduction}
The task for this project was to implement a game in Linux running on the EFM32GG-DK3750 Development Board, and using the provided game pad as an input device.
To use the game pad, a Linux device driver had to be made and accessed by the game program.
Even though the problem did not state what language to implement the game in, it was decided to do the whole process in C.

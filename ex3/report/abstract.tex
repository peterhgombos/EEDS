In this report, an implementation of the game Pong on uCLinux running on a
EFM32GG Development Board, with a custom driver for a external hardware game
pad is discussed.  The focus of the development is to save energy, and the
power consumption of the game is discussed here. The power usage of the game is
shown to be very efficient, averaging as little as $11.95 mA$.

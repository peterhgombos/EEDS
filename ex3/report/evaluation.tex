\section{Evaluation of Assignment}
We thought that the assignment itself was really nice, but some of the things
used, for example PTXDist, could have been better explained and explored. 

There was also a problem with having the Easter Holiday and a group member away
for a significant time at his third year excursion, but this could maybe been
solved with better time management on our part.

The lab has been terrible the last days, as it is way to hot, the oxygen level
is bad, and that the computers have problems, pausing execution every now and
then.

\section{Conclusion}


To compare the implementation of this implementation with the original Atari
Pong from 1976, it cost \$75 in 1976\cite{pongreview}, or \$329 in current
dollars.\footnotemark A single chip of the EFM32GG can be bought at newark.com
for \$17, and other components needed for creating almost the same game chip
with this implementation would not be much higher than this price. It can then
be said that a new system made with the hardware in this report, could cost only
10\% of the original price. A mass produced version would of course be much
cheaper.

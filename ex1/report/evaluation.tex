\section{Evaluation of Assignment}

While a bit challenging, when we understood the basis, the assignment was a bit too easy.
Writing the program took at most an hour, and testing not much more.
To then ask for such a big report seems a bit excessive.
We would like the actual task a bit more substantial, with more advanced features mandatory.

We think we have answered the assignment well, but testing could have been done with a bigger data set.
GDB came in handy when problems with assembly arose, and the energy profiler software was nice to use.

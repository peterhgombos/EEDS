\section{Evaluation of Assignment}

While a bit challenging, when we finally understood how to write the code the assignment was a bit simple.
Writing the program took at most an hour, and testing not much more.
To then ask for such a big report seems a bit excessive.
We would like the actual task a bit more substantial, and maybe explicitly say what of the more advanced things to do would be.

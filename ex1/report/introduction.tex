\section{Introduction}

This report presents the solution to exercise 1 of TDT4258, Energy Efficient Data Systems, at NTNU, spring 2014.
The assignment was to program a Giant Gecko Development Board (DK3750) to make LEDs on a provided game pad light up when buttons on the game pad were pressed.
The program should utilize interrupts to be more energy efficient, and if possible go in to sleep stages when not doing anything.
The whole program is to be written in Arm Thumb 2 assembly.

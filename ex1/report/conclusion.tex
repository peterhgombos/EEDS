\section{Conclusion}
By gradually improving the system architecture, we show how the lifespan of a digital circuit can be extended by multiple orders of magnitude.
The final system, which enters deep sleep after handling any interrupts, could live 14 years on a common coin cell battery.
This is satisfactory, as a coin cell battery would fail after ten years.

The system is also responsive; when the button is pressed, the LED instantaneously lights up.
This gives a great user experience, as the user would feel that his actions are responsible for the events.
